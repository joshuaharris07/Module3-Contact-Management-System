The Contact Management System keeps track of contact information, including name, phone number, email address, and address. The menu is used by entering the shown numbers, each is associated with a different function.

The system can also export the current list of contacts to a text file, and can import contact lists that have the same layout.

Directions for importing:
Save a text file to the current working directory.
The text file must have the following layout in order for the script to pull the contact information correctly, where ########## is the 10 digit phone number for the contact. Please ensure there are no spaces before or after the "|":
