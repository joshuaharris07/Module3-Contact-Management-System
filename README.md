# Module3-Contact-Management-System

The Contact Management System keeps track of contact information, including name, phone number, email address, and address. The menu is used by entering the shown numbers, each is associated with a different function.

The system can also export the current list of contacts to a text file, and can import contact lists that have the same layout.

Directions for importing:
Save a text file to the current working directory.
The text file must have the following layout in order for the script to pull the contact information correctly, where ########## is the 10 digit phone number for the contact:

##########
########## Name: enter name
########## Email address: enter email
########## Address: enter address

##########
########## Name: enter name
########## Email address: enter email
########## Address: enter address

Be sure to have an empty line after every contact in the text file, including the last one.
